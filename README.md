   # GitHub Basics Project – IBM Course  
A hands-on project by Juan Romero Salamanca for the IBM “Git and GitHub Basics” course (2025).  
This project practices core Git commands like clone, commit, branch, and pull request, as well as GitHub features like forking, creating pull requests, and merging branches.  

To get started, make sure you have Git installed (e.g., Git ≥2.30) and a GitHub account.  
To install this project, run the following commands:  
git clone https://github.com/juanromerosalamanca/github-basics-ibm-2025.git  
cd github-basics-ibm-2025  

To use the project, follow these steps:  
git checkout -b feature-add-message  
echo "Hello from Juan" > hello.txt  
git add hello.txt  
git commit -m "Add greeting message"  
git push origin feature-add-message  
Then go to GitHub and open a Pull Request to merge the changes.  

Project files include: hello.txt (a demo file), .gitignore (basic ignore settings), and this README.md file.  

If you want to contribute:
